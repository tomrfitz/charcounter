# Week 2

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomrfitz/charcounter.git
cd charcounter
yarn install
yarn dev
```

Project:

1. Build a basic Typescript Nodejs program that reads a txt file and prints the most common character to console (pick the right data structure!).

2. Incorporate helper arrow functions, try/catch to prevent crashing, and const any variable/function that should be const.

   - Add two other functions to the same Nodejs program:
   - Solve Two-Sum (leetcode) in Javascript, include a testing function that has most of the edge cases
   - Solve isPalindrome, function accepts a string and returns a boolean of if the string is a palindrome or not. Include a testing function that has most of the edge cases.

3. You may use leetcode or Google to learn the algo -> But write the testing function yourself and understand the algos.
4. Using git cli, upload all projects so far to your Github
